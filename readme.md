# Film Finder

>Using the IMDB API, I have created a program that returns the first movie (title, date and image) that matches our search.

## Installation
1. Install requirements. 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Inform your apikey.

IMDB API needs an apikey for queries.

* a) Go to [OMDBAPI](http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx) to request your apykey (There is a limited free plan). 

* b) Fill out the `config_template.ini` file and rename it to` config.ini`

## Run
```
python main.py
```
Please, remember that you need an internet connection
